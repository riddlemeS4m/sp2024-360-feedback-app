<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Effective Date: December 2024</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the 360 Feedback Portal. This app is designed for students and faculty at The University of Alabama and is free to use. By participating in university-sponsored groups, users agree to the collection and use of their data as described in this policy. If you have concerns, please contact your project manager or faculty sponsor.</p>

<h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
<p>The app collects the following types of data:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Identifiable Information (PII):</strong> University-issued emails and names.</li>
    <li><strong>Group and Project Data:</strong> User affiliations with university classes, project groups, team members, project managers, and faculty sponsors.</li>
    <li><strong>Survey Responses:</strong> Collected through Qualtrics, Microsoft Forms, or direct app submission. Feedback reports are anonymized and cannot be traced back to individual respondents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Data may be collected directly through the app or via third-party services such as Microsoft Graph.</p>

<h2>3. Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
<p>The data collected is used to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Generate anonymized feedback reports for group projects and ensure users cannot access reports belonging to others.</li>
    <li>Track metrics and generate end-of-semester reports for faculty and administration. These reports are also anonymized.</li>
    <li>Enhance user experience (e.g., displaying user names, class affiliations, and project details).</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<p>Collected data is not shared outside the university. Reports are stored in Google Drive and are accessible only to app admins, faculty sponsors, and project managers associated with specific groups. No data is sold to third parties, and there are no foreseeable circumstances requiring external disclosure.</p>

<h2>5. User Rights and Control</h2>
<p>Users may access and view data they have submitted at any time during normal app usage. For data updates or deletions, users should contact their project manager or faculty sponsor, who will liaise with an app admin to fulfill the request.</p>
<p>There is currently no opt-out feature. Participation in university-sponsored groups implies agreement to data collection.</p>

<h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>All users must log in to access app functionality. Security measures are in place to protect user data. In the event of a data breach, users will be notified within 7 days, and the university’s IT team will work to resolve any security issues. Data is regularly backed up to ensure app continuity.</p>

<h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
<p>User data is retained for the duration of the university class or project group. Data may be archived for up to one year after the project ends. Users may request deletion through their faculty sponsor or project manager.</p>

<h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>This app is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under this age. If we discover that such data has been collected, it will be deleted immediately. If you believe a child has provided data, please contact us.</p>

<h2>9. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The app integrates with third-party services such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Google Drive:</strong> Report storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Microsoft Graph:</strong> User authentication and data collection.</li>
    <li><strong>Digital Ocean:</strong> Cloud infrastructure and data storage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can review the privacy policies of these services for more information on how they handle data.</p>

<h2>10. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
<p>The app uses minimal cookies to maintain user login sessions and manage permissions. No advertising or tracking cookies are used.</p>

<h2>11. Policy Updates</h2>
<p>The privacy policy is reviewed once per semester and updated as necessary. Users will be notified of significant changes. The current version of this policy is always available on the website by clicking the "Privacy Policy" link in the footer.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
